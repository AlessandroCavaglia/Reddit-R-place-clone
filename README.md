# R/Place clone

This Github project is an exercise i decided to start after following a redis codelab at Reply organized by Vittorio Saettone.

## Objectives

Develop a clone of the reddit annual event R/Place, an interactive html page where everyone can place coloured pixels and try to build colorful drawings.

## Project Overview
The backend is developed with Java Spring using Redis for fast data access and a mysql database to store periodically the data, the front-end will probably be developed with plain html and js but i haven't yet decided this

## Project Status
In development
